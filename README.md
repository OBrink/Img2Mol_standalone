Img2Mol: inferring molecules from pictures
==========================================
![Img2Mol](Img2Mol.png)
Welcome to Img2Mol! :wave:.


## Overview
 Here we provide the implementation of the `img2mol` model using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) for training and inference, along with an exemplary jupyter notebook.
 
This repository is organized as follows:
* `examples/`: contains example images to apply our proposed model on
* `img2mol/`: contains necessary python modules for our proposed model
* `model/`: stores the trained model weights as pickled files. The download-link will be provided in future soon

## Installation
#### Requirements
```
python=3.8.5
pip=20.2.4
notebook=6.4.2
pillow=8.0.1
numpy=1.19.2
rdkit=2020.03.1
cudatoolkit=11.0
torchvision=0.8.0
torchaudio=0.7.0
pytorch=1.7.0
pytorch-lightning=1.0.8
```

#### Environment
Create a new environment:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bayer-science-for-a-better-life/Img2Mol.git
cd Img2Mol
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate img2mol
pip install .
```
*If you want to run Img2Mol as a standalone version with a locally loaded CDDD model instead of sending requests to our CDDD server, install the environment from `environment.local-cddd.yml` instead of `environment.yml`*
## Download Model Weights
You can download the trained parameters for the default model (~2.4GB) as described in our paper using the following link:
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pk21r4Zzb9ZJkszJwP9SObTlfTaRMMtF/view" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pk21r4Zzb9ZJkszJwP9SObTlfTaRMMtF/view </a>.  
Please move the downloaded file `model.ckpt` into the `model/` directory.  

If you are working with the local CDDD installation, please * [download and unzip the CDDD model](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1oyknOulq_j0w9kzOKKIHdTLo5HphT99h&export=download) and ove the directory *default_model* to `path/to/anaconda3/envs/img2mol/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cddd/data/`

Alternatively, we provide a bash script that will download and move the file automatically.
```bash
bash download_model.sh
```
If you have problems downloading the file using the bash script, please manually download the file using the browser.

## Examples
Check the example notebook `example_inference.ipynb` to see how the inference class can be used. A demonstration of the usage with the usage with the local CDDD model is demonstrated in `example_inference_local_cddd.ipynb`.

Please cite our manuscript if you use our model in your work.
